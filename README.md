# WATER_Drinking_Notifier_using_python
I created a simple Python project that reminds users to drink water every hour.
It is a simple yet effective project that can help individuals maintain proper hydration levels throughout the day.
The project involves writing a Python script that runs in the background and displays notifications at predefined intervals. The notifications can be customized to include a message, sound, or vibration to alert the user.
The application uses the time module to set timers and schedule notifications. It also uses the py-notifier library to display notifications on the user's desktop. The user can customize the intervals between notifications and the number of notifications to be displayed.
This project provides a practical implementation of Python's time and notification libraries and helps to improve the programmer's problem-solving and programming skills. It is also a useful tool for individuals who want to maintain proper hydration levels and stay healthy.
